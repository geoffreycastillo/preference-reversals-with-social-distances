This repository provides the data and code to reproduce the results in my paper 'Preference reversals with social distances'.

# Use

In Stata,  `cd` to the folder where you have saved `data.dta` and `code.do` and execute `code.do`.

# Variables

Variable names should be self-explanatory. There are also some value labels, e.g. for the session dates.
